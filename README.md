# AutoScribe

AutoScribe is a Python thing for dealing with QM.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requirements. (May require sudo)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
python3 main.py
```

`ctrl+A` to toggle drawing mode on and off.

**(Make sure to have selected the squiggly line tool thing in QM!!)**

Then type on your keyboard to draw the characters. Your mouse will be automated so please don't move it. 

`Enter` for tick, `Backspace` for cross. 

## Future improvements

- Add keys to scale text.
 - Change combo key to something less useful.
